		<h1><b>The <u class="anml1 nul1"></u> And The <u class="anml2 nul1"></u></b></h1>
	</div>
	<div class="cs-text4">
	<p> A <strong><u class="anml1 nul1"></u></strong> was making fun of the <strong><u class="anml2 nul1" ></u></strong> one day for being so slow.</p>
	<p> "Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.</p>
	
	<p><strong>"<u class="yesno nul1"></u>"</strong> replied the <strong><u class="anml2 nul1"></u></strong> "and I get there <strong><u class="speed nul1"></u></strong> than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it."</p>

	<p>The <strong><u class="anml1 nul1"></u></strong> was much <strong><u class="adj nul1"></u></strong> at the idea of running a race with the <strong><u class="anml2 nul1"></u></strong>, but for the fun of the things he agreed. So the <strong><u class="anml3 nul1"></u></strong>, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled, <strong>"<u class="mq nul1"></u>"</strong>.</p>
	
	<p>The <strong><u class="anml1 nul1"></u></strong> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <strong><u class="anml2 nul1"></u></strong> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <strong><u class="anml1 nul1"></u></strong>, he went off the course to practice <strong><u class="ver nul1"></u></strong> for <strong><u class="num nul1"></u></strong> hours until the <strong><u class="anml2 nul1"></u></strong> should catch up.</p>
	<p>The <strong><u class="anml2 nul1"></u></strong> mean while kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, prassed the place where the <strong><u class="anml1 nul1"></u></strong> was <strong><u class="ver nul1"></u></strong>. The <strong><u class="anml1 nul1"></u></strong> was so caught up in <strong><u class="ver nul1"></u></strong>; and when at last he did stop, the <strong><u class="anml2 nul1"></u></strong> was near the goal. The <strong><u class="anml1 nul1"></u></strong> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the <strong><u class="anml2 nul1"></u></strong> in time.</p>
